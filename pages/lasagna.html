   <h3><strong>Step 6</strong></h3>
   <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>

   <h3><strong>Step 7</strong></h3>
   <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p>
